# netlify-shortener

Uses netlify's redirect functionality to make a personal URL shortener. Works
beautifully :)

## Step 1

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener)

This will create a copy of the repo for your own account.

## Step 2

Clone the repo on your machine and run `npm run setup`.

## Step 3

Update the `_redirects` file to have the redirects you want. Update the
`baseUrl` property in the `package.json` file.

Optionally put this in your `.bash_profile` (for linux/mac) or whatever you're
using for your terminal:

```bash
alias shorten="node {repo-path}/shorten.js $1 $2";
```

If you want this in windows `cmd` then you can
[do this instead](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21040825).

With that you'll be able to run `shorten http://example.com` (generates a random
short code) and `shorten http://example.com/foo foo` (second argument is a
specified short code). It will automatically update `_redirects`, commit, and
push the repo which will trigger a deploy, then copy the URL to your clipboard.
Neat right!?

## Step 4

On Netlify, configure a custom domain.

## Step 5

That's it.

# FAQ

## How do I keep things updated?

There's a script in the `package.json` to wire your repo up to the upstream repo
if you want to keep it updated. Run `npm run setup` to get that connected. Then
whenever you want to get updates you can run `npm run update` and it'll rebase
your changes onto the updates from the original repo.

## What about analytics?

I don't think Netlify will give you analytics, but you should be able to set up
CloudFlare in front of your domain and I think they'll give you analytics.

## Can I keep my links private?

Netlify doesn't charge for linking up private repositories (HOW COOL IS THAT!?)
so you can make your GitHub repo private and that should keep your links
private.
